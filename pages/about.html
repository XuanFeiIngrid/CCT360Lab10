                    The dog, a domesticated descendant of the wolf and the first species to be domesticated over 15,000
                    years ago, has evolved alongside humans, gaining various abilities and roles such as hunting,
                    herding,
                    protection, companionship, and even aiding disabled individuals, earning them the title of 'man's

                    friend'.

                        In 1758, the Swedish botanist and zoologist Carl Linnaeus published in his Systema Naturae, the
                        two-word naming of species (binomial nomenclature). Canis is the Latin word meaning "dog",
                        and under this genus, he listed the domestic dog, the wolf, and the golden jackal. He classified
                        the domestic dog as Canis familiaris and, on the next page, classified the grey wolf as Canis
                        lupus. Linnaeus considered the dog to be a separate species from the wolf because of its
                        upturning tail (cauda recurvata), which is not found in any other canid.

                        The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in
                        Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, and morphological evidence shows that
                        this
                        dog was not a local wolf. The dog was dated to 14,223 years ago and was found buried along
                        with
                        a man and a woman, all three having been sprayed with red hematite powder and buried under
                        large,
                        thick basalt blocks. The dog had died of canine distemper. Earlier remains dating back to
                        30,000
                        years ago have been described as Paleolithic dogs, but their status as dogs or wolves remains
                        debated because considerable morphological diversity existed among wolves during the Late
                        Pleistocene.

                        Dog behavior is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of the domestic dog
                        (individuals or groups) to internal and external stimuli. As the oldest domesticated
                        species, dogs' minds inevitably have been shaped by millennia of contact with humans. As a
                        result of this physical and social evolution, dogs have acquired the ability to understand and
                        communicate with humans more than any other species and they are uniquely attuned to human
                        behaviors. Behavioral scientists have uncovered a surprising set of social-cognitive
                        abilities in domestic dogs. These abilities are not possessed by the dog's closest canine
                        relatives or other highly intelligent mammals, such as great apes, but rather parallel to
                        children's social-cognitive skills.

                        The dog is probably the most widely abundant large carnivoran living in the human
                        environment. In 2013, the estimated global dog population was between 700 million
                        and 987 million. About 20% of dogs live as pets in developed countries. In the
                        developing world, dogs are typically feral or communally owned, with pet dogs uncommon. Most of
                        these dogs live their lives as scavengers and have never been owned by humans, with one study
                        showing their most common response when approached by strangers is to run away (52%) or respond
                        aggressively (11%). Little is known about these dogs, or the dogs in developed countries
                        that are feral, strays, or are in shelters because the great majority of modern research on dog
                        cognition has focused on pet dogs living in human homes.
